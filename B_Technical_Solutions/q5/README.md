# NextJS Prototype Kit

My prototype kit for NextJS projects. It includes a basic setup for a NextJS project with a few components and pages to get you started.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will install the dependencies and start the development server. You can then access the site at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
