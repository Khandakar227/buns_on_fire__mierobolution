# BistroAI: AI-Based Dynamic Wait Time and Table Prediction System

## Executive Summary

BistroAI is an intelligent system that leverages artificial intelligence to solve critical operational challenges in restaurant management, enhancing customer experience while optimizing business efficiency.

## Current Challenges in Bistro92

1. **Order Wait-Time Anxiety**

   - Customers lack clarity on when their food will arrive
   - Results in frustration, negative reviews, and decreased loyalty

2. **Ingredient Waste and Stock Mismanagement**

   - Manual inventory ordering based on guesswork rather than data
   - Leads to food spoilage, stockouts, and revenue loss

3. **Static Menu Experience**

   - Customers see identical menus regardless of preferences or inventory
   - Causes reduced engagement and missed upselling opportunities

4. **Slow Table Turnover**

   - No system to predict table availability
   - Results in wasted seating capacity and longer wait times

5. **Limited Operational Visibility**
   - No monitoring of staff or device efficiency
   - Operational bottlenecks remain undetected

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. AI-Driven Predictive Wait Times

- **Solution:** Real-time wait time predictions with smart alerts
- **Benefit:** Reduces customer anxiety and builds trust
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - **Data Inputs:** Menu items, kitchen load, cooking times, staff availability, time patterns
  - **Model:** Regression models (XGBoost → LSTM/RNN)
