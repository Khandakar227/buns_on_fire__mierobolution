# BistroAI: AI-Based Dynamic Wait Time and Table Prediction System

## Executive Summary

BistroAI is an intelligent system that leverages artificial intelligence to solve critical operational challenges in restaurant management, enhancing customer experience while optimizing business efficiency.

## Current Challenges in Bistro92

1. **Order Wait-Time Anxiety**

   - Customers lack clarity on when their food will arrive
   - Results in frustration, negative reviews, and decreased loyalty

2. **Ingredient Waste and Stock Mismanagement**

   - Manual inventory ordering based on guesswork rather than data
   - Leads to food spoilage, stockouts, and revenue loss

3. **Slow Table Turnover**

   - No system to predict table availability
   - Results in wasted seating capacity and longer wait times

4. **Limited Operational Visibility**
   - No monitoring of staff or device efficiency
   - Operational bottlenecks remain undetected

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. AI-Driven Predictive Wait Times

- **Solution:** Real-time wait time predictions with smart alerts
- **Benefit:** Reduces customer anxiety and builds trust
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - **Data Inputs:** Menu items, kitchen load, cooking times, staff availability, time patterns
  - **Model:** Regression models (XGBoost → LSTM/RNN)
  - **Workflow:** Order placed → AI prediction → Customer countdown timer → Automated compensation for delays
  - **Impact:** Improved customer satisfaction and patience during peak hours

### 2. Inventory Forecasting

- **Solution:** Real-time inventory predictions and management
- **Benefit:** Reduces overstock and stockouts, improves margins
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - **Data Inputs:** Live orders, historical patterns, seasonal data, consumption rates
  - **Model:** Prophet → DeepAR forecasting
  - **Workflow:** 6-24 hour consumption forecasts → Restocking recommendations → Supplier API integration
  - **Impact:** 30-50% reduction in food waste

### 3. Table Turnover Prediction

- **Solution:** AI-powered table availability forecasting
- **Benefit:** Optimized seating and improved guest flow
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - **Data Inputs:** Seating duration, order status, eating patterns, service times
  - **Model:** Survival Analysis or LSTM forecasting
  - **Workflow:** Table completion prediction → Front-desk availability dashboard
  - **Impact:** Reduced wait times and improved throughput

### 4. Service Efficiency Monitoring

- **Solution:** AI models to detect service anomalies
- **Benefit:** Proactive identification of operational bottlenecks
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - **Data Inputs:** Device logs, staff service times, order fulfillment metrics
  - **Model:** Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forests, SVMs → Graph Neural Networks)
  - **Workflow:** Real-time performance monitoring → Automated alerts for issues
  - **Impact:** Preventative service failure management
